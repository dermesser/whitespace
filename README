whitespace.pl removes whitespace errors in files.

A whitespace error is:
	- tabs in an (else) empty line
	- spaces in an empty line
	- or both
Whitespace errors are created when working with a auto-indent
text editor like vim or some IDEs. This script removes the errors from
the file. The clean file is written back to the original file.
